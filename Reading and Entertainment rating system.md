My pointing system is this:

- `⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐` → **Smokin' Sexy Style!!**
- `⭐⭐⭐⭐` → **Smokin' Style!!**, it means that it's something that I really liked.
- `⭐⭐⭐` → **Alright**, it's something that was good to me, not to flashy, but I enjoyed it.
- `⭐⭐` → **Meh**, it's something that I just consumed but it's barely enjoyable.
- `⭐` → **Dull.**
