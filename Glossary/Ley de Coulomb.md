![F = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}](https://www.gstatic.com/education/formulas2/553212783/en/coulomb_s_law.svg)
Coulomb's inverse-square law, or simply Coulomb's law, is an experimental law of physics that calculates the amount of force between two electrically charged particles at rest. This electric force is conventionally called electrostatic force or Coulomb force.
$$F = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$
